# Blueprints for Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to various machine learning models. Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository acts as a blueprint, providing a step-by-step guide to building, evaluating, and fine-tuning specific machine learning models for different applications.

## Repository Structure

- **ML_Blueprints**: This folder contains blueprints for various machine learning models. Each notebook serves as a guide to building a specific type of model.
- **Application**: This folder contains real-world examples that implement the blueprints from the `ML_Blueprints` folder.

## Topics Covered

1. **Predicting Stock Prices**: A guide to using supervised learning models for stock price prediction.
2. **Derivative Pricing**: A blueprint for developing a machine learning model for pricing financial derivatives.
3. **Investor Risk Tolerance Modeling**: A comprehensive guide to modeling investor risk tolerance using machine learning.
4. _(More topics to be added)_
